The studentâ€™s feedback becomes a signal for the teacher to refine its strategy.\n\nThis could reshape how we train large models â€” think faster iteration, fewer resources, and more collaborative systems.\n\nðŸ“– Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02677\n\n#AI #DeepLearning #MachineLearning #GoogleDeepMind #AIResearch"

It's a big leap forward for creative professionals working in film, design, and marketing.\n\nThe future of content creation is increasingly generative â€” and Runway is pushing the pace.\n\nðŸ”— Source: https://research.runwayml.com/gen3alpha\n\n#GenAI #VideoAI #Runway #ProductLaunch #AIContent"

Meta might have the answer.\n\n@MetaAI just introduced **MoEfication**, a method to scale Transformers with mixture-of-expert modules â€” and itâ€™s memory efficient. This means smarter models that can access *far more knowledge* without exploding compute costs.\n\nOne more step toward memory-rich, reasoning-capable AI assistants.\n\nðŸ§  Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02455\n\n#MetaAI #Transformers #MachineLearning #AIResearch #MoEfication"

It's a big win for product teams and data scientists looking to go from dataset to deployable model in minutes.\n\nNo more excuses to delay that proof of concept. ðŸ˜‰\n\nðŸ”— Source: https://huggingface.co/autotrain\n\n#AI #MLOps #HuggingFace #AutoTrain #ProductLaunch"
